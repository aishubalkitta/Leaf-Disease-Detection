# Skin Disease Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network
* Skin diseases are among the most common medical conditions that affect millions of people worldwide. 
* Accurate and early diagnosis of skin diseases is crucial to prevent their progression and minimize their impact on the patient's quality of life.
* Traditional methods of skin disease diagnosis involve visual inspection by dermatologists, which is subjective and time-consuming.
* In recent years, machine learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promising results in the field of medical image analysis, including skin disease diagnosis. 
* CNNs are a class of deep learning algorithms that can automatically extract relevant features from images and classify them into different categories.
* In this project, we propose to develop a CNN-based system for skin disease prediction.
* The proposed system is trained on a large dataset of skin disease images to learn the patterns and features that are characteristic to different skin diseases. 
* The dataset is collected from publicly available sources and augmented to increase its size and diversity.
* The system uses transfer learning, a technique that allows the reuse of pre- trained models, to leverage the knowledge learned from other datasets and improve the performance of the model. 
* The developed system is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* The proposed system depicted an accuracy of 83.84%, along with a weighted average F1 â€“ Score of 84%.
