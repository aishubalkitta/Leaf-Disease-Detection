# Customer Care Registry
* This application is developed to assist customers in handling their complaints.
* Customers can submit a ticket with a thorough explanation of the problem.
* The Customer will be assigned an Agent to address the issue.
* An email notice will be sent to the client each time the agent is assigned to that person.
* Before the service is rendered, customers can examine the status of their tickets.
* Taking care of the entire process is the admin's primary task and duty, starting with the admin login, then creating an agent, and finally allocating customer complaints.
* Finally, a message will be issued to the client and the admin will be able to follow the job that has been given to the agent.
* The users will be able to create an account.
* After logging in, users can create a complaint and describe the issue they're having.
* An agent will be assigned to each user.
* They can see where their complaint stands.
