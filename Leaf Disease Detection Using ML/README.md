# Leaf Disease Detection Using Machine Learning
* Agriculture plays a key role in our national GDP.
* Identifying the leaf diseases and their diagnosis has become a tough job. 
* So, to overcome this difficulty, this process is automated using machine learning techniques. 
* There are five major methods involved in disease detection such as image acquisition, image pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and diagnosis. 
* Image acquisition is a collection of high-resolution images to train the model. 
* Image acquisition is achieved by suitable devices. 
* Initially, the images are taken from a dataset to train the model. 
* A tool named Teachable Machine Learning is used where separate classes are created for each disease. 
* Then the images are uploaded to each class, after which the model is ready to train. 
* After training the model, a TensorFlow Lite(tflite) file and a text file with labels is created. 
* This tflite file is embedded into the Android application, which predicts the disease.
